**Brief Description:**
Inspired by Prof. Michael Hoffman’s paper ‘Polylogarithmic Integrals and MZV (Multiple Zeta Values)’, we conjectured and subsequently proved novel results that relate integrals over the unit square of polylogarithms multiplied with different two variable polynomial fractions to linear combinations of MZVs.
