Hi, I'm Tom. I'm a first year DPhil (PhD) student in Machine Learning at the Torr Vision Group (TVG), University of Oxford. Here, I'm supervised by Prof. Philip Torr. 

My research interests include geometric and Bayesian methods and uncertainty quantification. 

In the past, I used to a be a little better at mathematics and was also breifly a teacher. You can find resources and materials realting to both of these in the relavent tabs. 

Feel free to reach out by email to chat or discuss anything ML related!
