Hi, I'm Tom. I'm a first year DPhil (PhD) student in Machine Learning at the Torr Vision Group (TVG), University of Oxford. Here I'm supervised by Prof. Philip Torr. 

My research interests include geometrical and Bayesian methods and uncertainty quantification generally within ML. 

Feel free to email me about anything ML related!
