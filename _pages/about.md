Hi, I'm Tom and I'm a first year DPhil (PhD) student in Machine Learning at the Torr Vision Group (TVG), University of Oxford, where I am supervised by Prof. Philip Torr. I'm interested in geometrical and Bayesian methods and uncertainty quantification generally. 

Feel free to email me about anything ML related!
