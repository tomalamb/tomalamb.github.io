Hi, I'm Tom and I'm a first year DPhil (PhD) student in Machine Learning at the Torr Vision Group (TVG), University of Oxford. Here I'm supervised by Prof. Philip Torr. 

I'm interested in geometrical and Bayesian methods and uncertainty quantification generally. 

Feel free to email me about anything ML related!
