Hi, I'm Tom. I'm a first year DPhil (PhD) student in Machine Learning at the Torr Vision Group (TVG), University of Oxford. Here, I'm supervised by Prof. Philip Torr. 

My research interests include geometric and Bayesian methods and uncertainty quantification in ML. 

In the past, I used to a be a little better at mathematics and was also breifly a teacher. You can find relavent material in the resources section. 

I'm currenlty also a team memeber of OxAI. If interested, please feel free to check out my blog posts where I try to give an accessibly complete and rigours (while hopefully being accessible) on various topics in ML and mathematics (/will when I stop procrasitinating this... ). 

Feel free to reach out by email to chat or discuss anything ML related!
